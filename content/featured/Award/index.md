This award celebrates students who personify Northeastern University’s ethos of humanics, its integration of technical, data, and human literacies. Recipients contribute significantly to understanding and improving the world around them by demonstrating curiosity, empathy, adaptability, and lifelong learning.

I received this award out of 150+ students going for Co-op from Northeastern in the year 2024.
