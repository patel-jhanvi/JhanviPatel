Spearheaded the creation of a Gen-AI procurement chatbot prototype for Northeastern's The Lab for Inclusive Entrepreneurship, utilizing cutting-edge AI and OpenAI API technologies.

Presented our research at Northeastern University's prestigious RISE expo, showcasing our work on Gen-AI and its potential to revolutionize the university's procurement processes. Our poster highlighted the integration of OpenAI API and demonstrated the chatbot's practical applications.

Conducted a workshop on Gen-AI during the university's largest AI in Action week, collaborating with professors and sponsors. Provided hands-on guidance on building Gen-AI chatbots using OpenAI API, culminating in a live demonstration of our project. The workshop was attended by over 60 students and professors, offering an immersive learning experience.
